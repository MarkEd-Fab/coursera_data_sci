title: "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Peer-Graded Assignment Repo"
---

<br/>
This repository is created to satisfy the requirements for completing Coursera course  
*Getting and Cleaning Data*

Please take note that I have intended to put all other future coding project requirements  for all the courses under *Data Science Specialization* on this repo,  
and so, for this particular course and project, I have created a sub folder `get_clean_data`.


<br/>
**Project Background**

In this particular project, students are asked to write R script, which should perform the  
following, using this [dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip):  

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set  
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement  
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject  


The raw R code can be found on `./get_clean_data/run_analysis.R`.

The final summary tidy data set named `Get_Clean_Final_Data.txt`, under the same sub-folder.
